# California

A style for the [Textual IRC client](https://www.codeux.com/textual/).

Goals are to look more "native" to macOS and to use modern CSS (flex, nesting,
custom properties, etc.)

Loosely based on Simplified by [Ben Alman](https://github.com/cowboy) and
[Michael](https://github.com/emsquared).
